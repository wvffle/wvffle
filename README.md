# Oh, hello!
Hey, I'm Kasper, and I'm a front-end developer with over 7 years of experience in Vue.js. I've used this framework since version 1.

Currently I'm working on [funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio/), a community-driven project that lets you listen and share music and audio within a decentralized, open network. I've migrated entire app from Vue 2 to Vue 3 + TypeScript and I'm actively working on redesigning of the UI and fixing bugs.

I'm also an engineer and for my thesis project I've created my own front-end framework called [waff](https://github.com/wvffle/waff).

During 2015 and 2016 I've been one of [mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) maintainers and I was focusing on fixing bugs, adding new features and controlling the quality of the pull requests.
